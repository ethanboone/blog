It was my first time in a classroom environment since I was in highschool in 2018, but even though haven't engaged in any formal education, I still felt able to retain all of the new information and concepts rather well. While this first week didn't involve any programming outside of styling webpages, I still felt adequately challenged with the information we covered.
